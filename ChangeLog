	Work on speeding up evaluation of single and full-flavour PDFs.
	Prior to this commit, the main native option for evaluating 
	a pdf_table was the EvalPdfTable_yQ (and related) call which
	filled all flavours. 

    Using `./benchmarking/prec_and_timing -dy 0.1 -output -outputgrid -nrep 10 -nrep-eval 10000000 -order -6`
	timing for one call of EvalPdfTable_yQ on a Mac M2 Pro (gfortran 13.2.0) was
	about 315 ns, and is now 243 ns.

	- EvalPdfTable_yQ
	  * various improvements, including that of uniform_interpolation_weights
	    (315 ns -> 286 ns)
	  * fixed max_lnlnQ_order (286 ns -> 266 ns)
	  * fixed y_wgts(0:WeightGridQuand_npnt_max-1) (266 ns -> 251 ns)
      * removing dynamic wgts(:,:) array (251 ns -> 243 ns)
	    (193 ns for order = -4)

    - uniform_interpolation_weights(...), uses a fixed-size rather than
	  dynamic-sized temporary dists array, and one loop is avoided
	  (prod=product(dists) is merged into the previous loop).

	- addition of EvalPdfTable_yQf(...) and _xQf(...) version to
	  evaluate a single flavour. _yQf takes 71ns.

	* src/pdf_tabulate.f90:

	- Added max_lnlnQ_order, currently set to 6, to avoid the need for dynamic allocation. 
    - added EvalPdfTable_yQf(...) and _xQf(...) functions, which take O(70ns)
	  to give a single flavour rather than O(250ns) for all flavours.
    - EvalPdfTable_yQ(...) now uses sub-parts of various fixed-sized arrays
	  rather than allocating things
	
	* src/convolution.f90:
	- public parameter WeightGridQuand_npnt_max, which is the maximum number of
	  points in a WeightGridQuant interpolation
	- new WgtGridQuant_noalloc, which gives the weight for a grid quantity
	  without any dynamic allocations

	* src/interpolation.f90:
	- uniform_interpolation_weights(...), uses a fixed-size rather than
	  dynamic-sized temporary dists array, and one loop is avoided
	  (prod=product(dists)) to avoid allocations and two loops merged
	  into each other.

	* src/convolution.f90:
	* src/integrator.f90:
	* tests/test_split_integration.f90:

	added functionality in InitGridConv and underlying integrators to
	split the integration regions so as to handle non-smooth or
	discontinuous convolution function (with an optional "split" array
	argument). Handling is still preliminary (e.g. ig_PolyWeight_expand
	does not yet have this functionality, which impose a limit that the 
	first split point needs to be beyond dy).

2024-02-06 Tue  <gavin.salam@physics.ox.ac.uk>

	Investigation of small differences in PDF outputs (at fairly large x
	values) between this version of hoppet and 1.2.x series, which are
	typically of the kind [-5.436262e-05-] v. {+5.436261e-05+},
	i.e. at the level of 2e-7. Some differences are up to 6e-7 (possibly
	rounding-amplified), and mostly at larger x values. 

	The differences turn out to be due to the replacement, in
	convolution.f90, of a call to ig_PolyWeight with one to
	ig_PolyWeight_expand. The latter uses a second order expansion of the
	interpolation when close to y=0, which was originally introduced in
	order to work around issues with coefficient functions (which have
	[log^n(1-x)]_+ structures that are delicate near x=1). 

	However the transition, at 1e-5, seems to be a bit too early, and
	should instead be at epsilon**(1/3) * dy. Reducing it changes one
	structure function "make check" point (F3Z(NNLO), x=1.0000E-04,
	Q=100; near a zero of F3Z, so extra delicate) by about 1e-6
	relative; other choices seem stable at the level of 2e-8;

	    -3.8985528E-04:  1e-5 (i.e. original code @f199aac48)
		-3.8985487E-04:  3e-6_dp
        -3.8985485E-04:  3e-6_dp * dy (NEW CODE)
        -3.8985486E-04:  quad precision for interp operations, no expansion
        -3.8985487E-04"  third order, 1e-4*dy     

	Ultimately, we will go with 3e-6_dp * dy and second order. This
	change also seems to bring us back in agreement with 1.2.x series
	for the PDF evolution results (at least for the 7 digits printed in
	the above test). 

	* src/types.f90:
	added commented out qp definition

	* src/integrator.f90:
	switched transition point as indicated above

	* example_f90/structure_functions_example.default_output:
	changed F3Z point (cf above) from -3.8986E-04 to -3.8985E-04

2024-02-05  Alexander Karlberg  <karlberg@karlberg-ThinkPad-X1-Extreme-Gen-3>

	* src/hoppet_v1.h: Forgot to propagate change in StartStrFct and
	InitStrFct to the C++ interface.

2024-01-31  Alexander Karlberg  <karlberg@karlberg-ThinkPad-X1-Extreme-Gen-3>

	* src/structure_function.f90:
	Moved the setting of muF and muR to InitStrFcts so that one only
	has to start once to run with different scales. At the same time
	streamlined how the scales are passed around and put in some
	checks that the structure functions are actually called with the
	scales that they initialised with. Propagated changes to the
	examples.

2024-01-04 Thu  <gavin.salam@physics.ox.ac.uk>

	* src/NameSelect.pl:
	* benchmarking/NameSelect.f90:
	changed generation script to incorporate longer name length as 
	included in PR #5

	* [various]:
	merged changes from Andrii Verbytskii (PR #5) to CI, renaming of
	random -> hoppetrandom (to avoid conflicts), addressing some
	implicit variable typing but not all. 

2024-01-03 Wed  <gavin.salam@physics.ox.ac.uk>

	* src/qed_splitting_functions.f90: moved calculation of ln1mx inside
	case(cc_REAL,cc_REALVIRT), as in QCD splitting functions, so that
	it's not called when all that's being done is evaluation of the
	DELTA piece. This should resolve an FPE issue reported by Andrii
	Verbytskyi, which came about because the cc_DELTA piece is always
	called with y=0, x=1.

	* src/streamlined_interface.f90:
	trying another solution for the variables bounds issue in hoppetEval.

2023-12-22 Fri  <gavin.salam@physics.ox.ac.uk>

	* src/pdf_representation.f90:
	* src/random.f90:
	replaced ran() -> ran_one() to avoid conflict with intrinsic fortran
	function.

	* src/welcome_message.f90:
	* CMakeLists.txt:
	updated version numbers to reflect 1.3.0-devel

2023-12-04 Mon  <gavin.salam@physics.ox.ac.uk> + Alexander

	* src/hoppet_v1.h:
	- alignment of interfaces with changes below, including a StrFctNoMu
	  for evaluations with muR and muF as they are constrained by the
	  scale choice.
	- also put structure function and scale-choice indices (new in C++
	  interface) into a new hoppet namespace

	* src/structure_functions.f90:
	added checks on muR and muF in StrFct calls (consistency and/or presence
	as appropriate depending on the scale choice)

	* src/structure_functions.f90:
	* example_f90/structure_functions_example.f90:
	* example_f90/structure_functions_example.default_output:
	- removed redundant Qmin_PDF argument from StartStrFct 
	  (and associated usage in example)
	- updated default mW and mZ values to 2022 PDG and 
	  regenerated default validation output (checking
	  that things passed prior to the change).


2023-11-12 Sun  <gavin.salam@physics.ox.ac.uk>

	* LICENSE: *** ADDED ***
	added a license file to reflect GPLv3 status

2023-10-27  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@physics.ox.ac.uk> + Paolo + Alexander

	* scripts/check:
	* example_f90/tabulation_example_qed_streamlined.default_output: (*** ADDED ***, symlink)
	* example_f90/tabulation_example_qed_streamlined.f90:
	arranged for tabulation_example_qed_streamlined to be added to make check

    * src/hoppet-config.in:
	added --version output flag

	* many files:

	merged the QED and struct-func-devel-exact-coefficient-functions
	branches into a new 2023-10-pre1.3.0 branch, which is what we
	should use going forward.

2023-10-27 NOTE That preceding months involve two streams of change (QED and structure functions) which have been kept separate

	* src/pdf_tabulate.f90:
	* src/qed_evolution.f90:
	* src/streamlined_interface.f90:
	added with_Plq_nnloqed argument to EvolvePdfTableQED and
	QEDQCDEvolvePDF and removed the global variable that 
	was being used previously.
	Also added check:
	* with_Plq_nnloqed==.true. is not being used with with_nqcdloop_qed==0 
	* mismatches of quark masses between QCD and QED couplings
    * that nqcdloop_qed <= 1
	
2023-10-03 Tue  <gavin.salam@physics.ox.ac.uk> with Giulia and Paolo

	* src/pdf_general.f90:
	InitPDF_LHAPDF() used to expect the LHAsub to set -6:6; 
	now it expects -6:6 with plain QCD evolution, but
	the full size of the flavour dimension if the upper limit
	is anything other than ncompax=7 (e.g. for QED evolution 
	it should go up to ncompmaxLeptons=11).

	* src/streamlined_interface.f90:
	switched this over the version prepared by Giulia and Paolo

	* example_f90/tabulation_example_qed.default_output:
	* example_f90/tabulation_example_qed.f90:

	reworked the QED initial condition that had been put in a few
	commits ago (no ChangeLog entry) so that it conserves momentum sum
	rule and updated the default output so that make check works...

2023-09-21 Thu  <gavin.salam@physics.ox.ac.uk> + Giulia

	* example_f90/tabulation_example.f90:
	* example_f90/tabulation_example_qed.f90:
	switched these over to use InitGridDefDefault

	* src/qed_objects.f90:
	added Delete for the QED splitting matrices

	* src/qed_evolution.f90:
	fixed serious memory leak in QEDQCDEvolvePDF where internal
	coupling_qcd_zero was not being deleted at the end of the function.

	* src/dglap_objects.f90:
	fixed minor memory leak, where Delete(MassThresholdMat) was leaving
	out one piece of the deletion

2023-09-16 Sat  <gavin.salam@physics.ox.ac.uk>

	* example_f90/tabulation_example_qed.f90:  *** ADDED ***
	* example_f90/tabulation_example_qed.default_output:  *** ADDED ***
	added this example to show how to use basic QED + QCD evolution
	to obtain a tabulated QED PDF and included default output

	* src/qed_coupling.f90:
	updated alpha(0) and lepton masses to 2022 PDG value_at_scale_0.

	Also updated interface to InitQEDCoupling so that the user can
	make their own choice for the effective light quark masses,
	which they can tune so that alpha(0) and alpha(mZ) are both
	reasonably sensible.

	* src/hoppet_v1.f90:
	included the QED modules

	* src/pdf_tabulate.f90:
	fixed an issue where tab%tab_iflv_max was not being sets
	correctly, causing returned PDF to be unset beyond iflv=6

	* scripts/check:
	added a loop over tests to run and make sure failure causes exit 1

2023-09-13  Giulia Zanderighi  <zanderi@mpp.mpg.de>

	* example_f90/structure_functions_example.f90
	* src/hoppet_v1.h
	* src/structure_functions.f90:
	Created sf_tables that now hold the structure functions such that
	the stream lined tables can still be used independently. Also
	removed unused 'rts' from structure functions. This needs to
	propagate to proVBFH and disorder. Examples modified and checked.


2023-10-16  Alexander Karlberg  <alexander.karlberg@cern.ch>

	* src/structure_functions.f90:
	Added Doxygen style comments. Relabelled all structure function indices. 

2023-10-14 Sat  <gavin.salam@physics.ox.ac.uk>

	* src/structure_functions.f90:
	some work on comments
2023-10-13  Alexander Karlberg  <alexander.karlberg@cern.ch>

	* src/structure_functions.f90:
	Changed the two public functions muR, muF to sf_muR, sf_muF due to
	conflicts in other programs that depend on hoppet (reported by
	Andrea Banfi for H1jet and HELAC+OpenLoops)
2023-09-22  Alexander Karlberg  <alexander.karlberg@cern.ch>

	* src/xc*p.f:
	Rewrote all NNLO and N3LO parametrised coefficient functions to
	use proper doubles rather than just float. Moved some divisions by
	constants into parameters and multiplications.

2023-09-18  Alexander Karlberg  <alexander.karlberg@cern.ch>

	* src/streamlined_interface.f90 (hoppetSetExactDGLAP)
	* src/hoppet_v1.h:
	added a function to the streamlined_interface that allows the user
	to swap to the exact DGLAP objects

2023-09-16 Sat  <gavin.salam@physics.ox.ac.uk>

	* .github/workflows/CI.yml:
	added gfortran-13 to matrix of compilers to test

2023-09-16 Sat  <gavin.salam@physics.ox.ac.uk>

	* src/CMakeLists.txt:
	reworked this to enable conditional compilation of exact
	coefficient functions, and to allow for installation
	of library + include files (but not yet .mod files)

	* src/{ => unused}/xclns3p-orig.f:
	moved this out of the way to avoid confusing build system without
	two identical copies

	* src/integrator.f90:
	* src/xclns3p.f:
	removed some DO with line label termination (which is a deleted
	feature in F2018 and so was causing warnings)

2023-09-15 Fri  <gavin.salam@physics.ox.ac.uk>

	* benchmarking/structure_functions_benchmark_checks.f90:
	added options -exact-coefs (to turn on exact coefficient functions,
	instead of parametrised) and -outdir to select the output directory.

	* src/coefficient_functions_holder.f90:
	* src/exact-coeffs/coefficient_functions_holder_exact.f90:
	moved exact NNLO and N3LO coefficient functions into a separate
	file, with a view to facilitating conditional compilation

	* src/no-exact-coefs/coefficient_functions_holder_exact.f90:
	the alternative file to use when exact coefficient functions 
	are not being compiled in 

	* configure:
	added --enable-exact-coefs option to turn on compilation
	of exact coefficient special_functions (looks for anything in an
	exact-coefs sub-directory; without the option looks for anything in
	a no-exact-coefs sub-directory)

	* src/xc*e.f -> src/exact-coefs/:
	moved all the exact coefficient function files into a separate
	directory, which is only included if the --enable-exact-coefs option
	is passed to configure

	* example_f90/{ => exact-coefs}/coefficient_functions_test.f90:
	moved this into a sub-directory so that it is compiled
	only when exact coefficient functions are included

	* .github/workflows/CI.yml:
	added a check that the exact coefficient functions compile

2023-09-15  Alexander Karlberg  <alexander.karlberg@cern.ch>

	* src/streamlined_interface.f90:
	* src/structure_functions.f90:
	* src/hoppet_v1.h:
	changed the argument that StrFct() etc takes from y = -log(x) to x
	to conform with the rest of the code. Moved the call to
	hoppetStartExtended outside the structure functions so a user can
	more easily decide on the grids to use.

2023-09-14  Alexander Karlberg  <alexander.karlberg@cern.ch>

	* src/streamlined_interface.f90
	* src/hoppet_v1.h:
	added functions to call the structure functions in the
	streamlined interface

	* example_f77/cpp_structure_functions_example.cc:
	added a C++ example for structure functions use

	* src/xc3ns3e.f
	* src/xclgl3e.f
	* src/xclns3e.f
	* src/xclps3e.f:
	added the exact 3-loop DIS coefficient functions. Currently they
	do not work due to a numerical issue in hplog5. Removed factor 2
	in structure functions introduced for VBF but which should not be
	there in the DIS definition. Swapped Wp/Wm to align with DIS
	convention. Fixed a number of bugs in the fl11 term of the NC N3LO
	structure functions as reported by Valerio Bertone. Fixed
	couplings for the EM and Zgamma structure functions which were
	never used in VBF and therefore not tested.

	* benchmarking/structure_functions_benchmark_checks.f90:
	added file for structure function benchmarks. Should reproduce the
	results that will be published with Valerio Bertone.

	* scripts/check:
	added a check for the structure functions

2023-03-12 Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@physics.ox.ac.uk>

	* .github/workflows/CI.yml:
	added an attempt at continuous integration using github actions

2023-03-12  Alexander Puck Neuwirth + small mods by Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@physics.ox.ac.uk> 

	* src/warnings_and_errors.f90:
	wae_error(...): replaced "stop" with "call exit(-1)", which
	should return a failure exit code. Note, this is non-standard, but
	seems to be supported in both intel and gfortran.

	* src/convolution.f90:
	replaced several "stop" instructions with calls to wae_error(...)

2023-02-01  Alexander Karlberg  <alexander.karlberg@cern.ch> 

	* src/structure_functions.f90:
	Fixed wrong couplings used in the FgZ structure functions. Now
	initialising non-standard iflv_max and fixed bug where F3gZ was
	set equal to F3Z

2023-02-01  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@physics.ox.ac.uk> (with Alexander Karlberg)

	* src/pdf_tabulate.f90:
	started to add support for table interpolation to use a
	non-standard iflv_max

2023-01-29  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@physics.ox.ac.uk>

	* src/welcome_message.f90:
	updated date in welcome message

2022-07-20  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@physics.ox.ac.uk>

	* src/dglap_holders.f90 (InitDglapHolder): 
	* src/dglap_objects.f90 (InitSplitMatTimeNLO): 
	* src/splitting_functions.f90:
	added ingredients needed for FFN time-like evolution at NLO. Tests
	ongoing. 

2021-09-22 Wed  <gavin.salam@physics.ox.ac.uk>

	* src/convolution.f90:
	arrange in-range tests for y-in-range to make sure that if y is nan
	then the test fails.

2021-07-25  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@physics.ox.ac.uk>

	* src/convolution.f90:
	added DisableGridLocking() and RestoreGridLocking()
	for user programs to be able to more safely handle
	grid locking suspension.

	Implemented minor fix to grid_conv initialisation with negative
	orders, whereby the ny entry of the grid_conv matrix missed one
	contribution. This doesn't affect normal evolution with physical
	PDFs, because that element of the grid_conv entry multiplies the
	pdf at iy=0, which is zero in physical PDFs. But it can affect the
	use of the grid_conv entries when they are to be interpreted as
	physical quantities in their own right.

2021-05-21  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@physics.ox.ac.uk>

	* src/special_functions.f90:
	* src/integrator.f90:
	replaced a set of number-terminated do loops with end do
	constructs; ran make check to verify results have not changed.

2021-05-12  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@physics.ox.ac.uk>

	* src/CMakeLists.txt:
	added this from Gregory Soyez to facilitate
	use with other projects

2020-08-29 Gavin Salam<gavin.salam@physics.ox.ac.uk>

	* src/pdf_tabulate.f90:
	replaced intent(out) with intent(inout) so that
	automatic deletion works

2020-08-27 Gavin Salam<gavin.salam@physics.ox.ac.uk>

	* src/pdf_tabulate.f90
	This should now detect if a table had previously been allocated
	and delete it accordingly.

2020-07-08  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@cern.ch>

	* src/pdf_representation.f90:
	removed "pure" from pdfr_HumanToEvln_sc, because it wasn't being
	relied on and caused issues with the -fno-automatic option
	that is used in POWHEG.

2020-04-14  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@cern.ch>

	* benchmarking/benchmark.f90:
	changed sub_defs_io "use" to avoid conflicts with 
	Value(...) from hoppet (as reported by Federico Buccioni)


2018-12-27  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@cern.ch>

	* src/qed_evolution.f90:
	this now handles evolution below the QCD scale, using a zero QCD
	coupling to signal to the evolution.f90 routine that it should not
	do any QCD evolution there.

	* src/evolution.f90:
	some small changes to aid communibation with the QED evolution
	code, including skipping certain bits of code when alphas = 0, and
	changing ev_force_old_dt to be a variable (rather than a
	parameter), so that one can play with it.

	* src/qed_coupling.f90 (qed_coupling_module):
	switched the scale for the turn-on of 3 light flavours
	to be 1 GeV, to avoid issues with QCD couplings that aren't
	defined below that scale. 

	* src/qcd_coupling.f90: 
	* src/new_as.f90:
	added support for nloop = 0, i.e. fixed coupling. It sets up all
	the usual infrastructure (flavour thresholds, etc.), but then when
	you ask for the coupling, it just returns the fixed value that it
	was initialised with.

	* tests/coupling-fixed.f90: *** ADDED ***
	for running a quick test that the new fixed-coupling functionality
	works.

2017-10-31  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@cern.ch>

	* src/welcome_message.f90 (HoppetWelcomeMessage):
	switched to 1.2.1-devel

2017-10-30  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@cern.ch>

	* NEWS:
	finalised NEWS file for 1.2.0 release

	* src/welcome_message.f90 (HoppetWelcomeMessage):
	changed version to 1.2.0

	* src/new_as.f90 (na_Init): 
	fixed bug that arises when nloop is not specified (use of optional
	nloop argument instead of nah%nloop)

	* doc/HOPPET-v1-doc.tex: 
	* tarit.sh:
	added pdf files to tarball and added a whole bunch of pdf files +
	changed documentation so that it works with both pdflatex and
	latex.
	Also changed front page to reflect contributions from Frederic and
	Alexander. 

	* tests/README-hoppet-tests.org:
	added some old test output (from April 22)

2017-02-02  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@cern.ch>

	* src/evolution.f90 (ev_CrossMassThreshold):
	bug fix to address issue reported by Florian Lyonnet of error of

	   FATAL ERROR in cobj_ConvMTM:
           Mass threshold matrix is undefined

	when using 2-loop cached evolution. It was caused by
	evop%cross_mass_threshold not being properly initialised to
	.false. in that situation. Also removed some redundant code
	lines.

2016-07-XX NOTE That preceding months involve two streams of change (QED and structure functions) which have been kept separate

2016-07-06  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@cern.ch>

	* src/qed_objects.f90 (qed_objects):
	added routine (Copy) for copying qed_split_mat objects (and
	sub-object)

	* src/sort.f90 (sort):
	added sort_array() routine which acts as if an in-place sort is
	carried out (relying on idx); made it public (and also swap)

	* src/pdf_tabulate.f90 (FillPdfTable_LHAPDF):
	fixed serious issue for tabulations where nf info is associated,
	where Q was being recalculated wrongly for each iQ rather than
	read in from the table%Q_vals array.

2016-06-26  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@cern.ch>

	* src/couplings.f90:         *** ADDED ***
	* src/qcd_qed_coupling.f90:  *** ADDED ***
	* src/qed_coupling.f90:
	* tests/test_qed.f90
	copied couplings.f90 over from hopper (aborted OO v2 of
	hoppet). It has the small adaptation that any segment should
	always have at least n_interp+1 nodes.

	Then used it to build the QCDQEDCoupling type in
	qcd_qed_coupling. Interface may yet evolve.

	Small mods also to qed_coupling.f90 to make useful pieces public.

	Conclusion from tests/test_qed.f90 is that effect of mixed QCD/QED
	effects in the running coupling are ~0.2% on the QED coupling,
	which, given that we don't have a proper treatment of hadronic
	thresholds, is irrelevant.

	where diff is the difference between running without and with the
	mixed terms. (If running with pure QCD and QED evolutions the
	differences are zero).


2016-06-23  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@cern.ch>

	* src/pdf_general.f90:
	started introducing support for PDFs with non-standard number of
	flavours. WORK HERE IS INCOMPLETE

	* src/pdf_tabulate.f90
	added support for non-standard number of flavours and for a
	tabulation that uses QED evolution. Currently untested.

	* example_f77/compare_lhapdf_hoppet.f:
	changed the default pdf


2016-06-07  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@cern.ch>

	* src/qed_objects.f90 (qed_objects):
	tried to get rid of Fortran-2003 constructs

2016-06-07  Gavin Salam  <gsalam@lxplus0031.cern.ch>

	* scripts/makef95makefile: 
	this now handles gfortran compiler names such as gfortran-61, etc.

2016-05-27  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@cern.ch>

	* src/qed_objects.f90 (AllocPDFWithLeptons):
	fixed wrong upper bound for flavour dimension

	* src/qed_coupling.f90 (qed_coupling_module):
	added an option to pass value_at_scale_0 when initialising
	the coupling (e.g. to test sensitivity to higher orders, etc.)

	Also changed the "light quarks" mass to 0.5GeV.

	* src/qed_evolution.f90 (QEDQCDEvolvePDF):
	fixed a bug with the initial nf values

2016-05-26  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@cern.ch>

	* src/welcome_message.f90 (HoppetWelcomeMessage):
	updated date!

	* src/qed_coupling.f90:
	added info on n_thresholds inside the qed_coupling type and
	extended the bounds of some of the arrays to make it easier to
	access threshold information without worrying about out-of-bounds
	accesses. 

	* src/qed_evolution.f90:  *** ADDED ***
	added this routine for QED evolution, including thresholds;
	comprehensive testing still remains to be performed.

	For now alphas and alpha_QED still have separate evolutions
	(whereas with O(alpha alpha_s) splitting kernels they should have
	coupled evolution).

	* src/evolution.f90:
	factored out some part of the machinery into a new module,
	evolution_helper, so that it can be used by the QED
	evolution. Nothing should change in the public interface.

	* scripts/makef95makefile:
	added a "-g" option to gfortran by default, to aid with debugging

	* src/qed_objects.f90: *** ADDED ***
	started work on a module for holding QED splitting matrices,
	performing the flavour convolutions, etc. Currently the LO
	QED splitting matrix appears to be working. The NLO is also mostly
	tested. 

	* src/streamlined_interface.f90 (hoppetStartExtended):
	this now uses InitGridDefDefault for creating its grid

	* src/convolution.f90:
	added InitGridDefDefault(grid, dy, ymax, order) to make it
	a bit easier to create good grids

	added 2d version of TruncatedMoment

2016-05-15  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@cern.ch>

	* tests/test_qed.f90:
	added tests of moments of the QED splitting functions.

	* src/splitting_functions.f90:
	made sf_S2(x) public, for us in the qed_splitting_functions

	* src/qed_splitting_functions.f90: *** ADDED ***
	added the QED splitting functions from 1512.00612

2016-05-10  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@cern.ch>

	* src/qed_coupling.f90:
	put in correct values for lepton masses and fine structure
	constant + removed diagnostic printouts.

2016-04-24  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@cern.ch>

	* tests/test_qed.f90: *** ADDED ***
	file for first tests of QED coupling

	* src/qed_coupling.f90: *** ADDED ***
	got a first basic version of a 1-loop QED coupling -- interface
	may evolve
2016-07-08  Frédéric Dreyer  <frederic.dreyer@gmail.com>

	* src/structure_functions.f90:
	added a third implementation of the structure functions, where we add up
	all orders before the convolution of the coefficient functions with the
	PDF; this is possible only for scale_choice=0,1.

	* example_f90/structure_functions_example.f90 :
	added an example program showing sample usage of structure functions module;
	moved the handling of the pdf outside of structure_functions.f90, and into
	the actual program.

2016-06-26  Frédéric Dreyer  <frederic.dreyer@gmail.com>

	* src/structure_functions.f90:
	- added optional variable flavour-number scheme for the structure functions.
	- added the gamma-Z structure function.
	these features still need to be cross-checked against other codes.

2016-06-09  Frédéric Dreyer  <frederic.dreyer@gmail.com>

	* src/integrator.f90 (ig_PolyWeight_expand):
	* src/convolution.f90 (conv_GCAf_Helper):
	added an additional integrator ig_PolyWeight_expand which expands terms
	around zero. This avoids numerical issues close to zero for real pieces.

	* src/streamlined_interface.f90:
	changed size of tables for integration of structure functions in
	existing framework

	* src/structure_functions.f90:
	* src/coefficient_functions_holder.f90:
	* src/xc*.f:
	fixed numerical convergence issues at large x by taking a series
	expansion close to x=1.

2016-06-07  Frédéric Dreyer  <frederic.dreyer@gmail.com>

	* src/coefficient_functions_holder.f90:
	* src/xc*.f:
	added all the coefficient functions, implemented up to N3LO, with
	both the parametrised and the exact NNLO implementation.

	* src/structure_functions.f90:
	added the implementation of the structure functions, as used in proVBFH.

2016-04-04  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@cern.ch>

	* doc/HOPPET-v1-doc.tex:
	added mention of running up to 4 loops

	* src/new_as.f90 (na_Init):
	added protection against 4-loop running with non-standard colour factors.

	* src/welcome_message.f90 (HoppetWelcomeMessage):
	added Frederic and Alexander as contributors.

	* src/qcd.f90
	* src/new_as.f90
	* src/types.f90

	Put in changes from Alexander Karlberg to support 4-loop running
	of the coupling, including flavour thresholds. Alexander has
	tested this against my python code (itself tested against
	rundec). Note -- there's support only for QCD colour factors, not
	general colour factors.

2015-06-26  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@cern.ch>

	* src/streamlined_interface.f90:
	added some code to delete old tabulations and dglap holder if
	hoppetStart is called more than once.

2015-04-22  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@cern.ch>

	* NEWS:
	started work on comments for 1.2.0 release

	* doc/HOPPET-v1-doc.tex:
	added note on multi-splitting function support in
	hoppetEvalSplit. 

	* src/welcome_message.f90 (HoppetWelcomeMessage):
	upped version number to 1.2.0-devel (will now try to follow
	semantic version 2.0.0 numbering for releases, http://semver.org/,
	so that patch number changes are mainly for bug fixes).

	* tests/README-hoppet-tests.org: *** ADDED ***
	added this file in order to keep track of future tests

	* tests/streamlined_multisplit.f90: *** ADDED ***
	added this routine for testing the nested splitting-function
	convolutions.

	* src/dummy_pdfs.f90: *** ADDED ***
	added this module with dummy unpolarized PDFs (given how often
	they are needed); interface of internal functions may still evolve

	* src/streamlined_interface.f90:
	removed commented bits of code and improved comments in some
	places now that tests have been run for hoppetEvalSplit.

2015-04-21  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@cern.ch>

	* src/streamlined_interface.f90:
	work in progress on getting support for composite iloop values
	(e.g. 11, 12, 21, 111) in hoppetEvalSplit.

2015-04-07  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@cern.ch>

	* src/pdf_tabulate.f90 (EvalPdfTable_yQ):
	removed redundant if statement for case where we are out of Q
	bounds (correct handling was already taking place elsewhere).

2015-03-24  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@cern.ch>

	* scripts/makef95makefile:
	removed perl warning message about unnecessary "defined" in a
	couple of places; 

2013-04-18  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@cern.ch>

	* example_f77/Makefile (LHAPDFLIBS): 
	  now set using lhapdf-config (assuming it's in your path).

	* example_f77/compare_lhapdf_hoppet.f:
	  now explicitly takes alphas(MZ) from LHAPDF (and set dlnlnQ
	  automatically based on dy).

2012-12-24  Gavin Salam  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* src/streamlined_interface.f90: 
	  added a note that tables(0) should become a "preserved" part of
	  the hoppet interface, for people who want the convenience of the
	  streamlined interface, but also a little more power.

2012-08-03  Gavin Salam  <gsalam@macth69.cern.ch>

	* src/welcome_message.f90: 
	  switched version over to 1.1.6-devel (but everything is for now
	  still identical to 1.1.5)

	* src/welcome_message.f90: 
	  added publication reference to welcome message.

2012-08-03  Gavin Salam  <gsalam@macth69.cern.ch>

	* NEWS
	* src/welcome_message.f90: 
	  updated for release of version 1.1.5
	  (HoppetWelcomeMessage): 

	* doc/HOPPET-v1-doc.tex:
	  documented PartonLuminosity(...) function.

2012-07-30  Gavin Salam  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>


	* scripts/makef95makefile: 
	  --install-modules, if present, indicates that modules should be
	  installed by default; --mod-prefix=... indicates a non-standard location

	* configure:
	  added support for --mod-prefix, and arranged for default
	  mod-prefix to be PREFIX/include/hoppet + made use of the new
	  --install-modules option of scripts/makef95makefile

	* INSTALL:
	  adapted the documentation to reflect the new module installation scheme

	* hoppet-config.in:
	  --fflags now handles the configurable modules location;
	  --ldflags can now be used as a synonym for --libs


2012-07-27  Gavin Salam  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* hoppet-config.in: 
	  added error handling in case of unrecognized arguments;
	  added an --fflags argument for flags to be used with fortran
	  compilers.

	* scripts/makef95makefile: 
	  changed behaviour of install, so that it now also installs the
	  .mod files (needed for programs like JetVHeto),
	  without having to explicitly perform a "make install-mod".

	  Also ensured that .h and .mod files are installed with -rw-r--r--
	  permissions (rather than executable, as before).

2012-05-17  Gavin Salam  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* README: 
	  added a note about ranlib "no symbol" warnings. Thanks to Merjin
	  van de Klundert for suggesting this.

2012-05-13  Gavin Salam  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* README:
	  a few small edits to update things re compilation

	* tarit.sh: 
	  ChangeLog had been left out of the tarball; so now include it.

2012-05-11  Gavin SALAM  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* src/pdf_tabulate.f90 (get_lnlnQ_wgts): 
	  fixed bug that when Q was too small lnln came out as NaN, as did
	  the PDF (while it should have been frozen or zero). The lnln
	  function now returns a large negative number instead.

	* src/dglap_objects.f90: 
	  changed error message in case of mismatch of flavours between
	  PDF and splitting function so that both nf values get printed.

2012-04-17  Gavin Salam  <gsalam@macth69.cern.ch>

	* src/qcd_coupling.f90 (qcd_coupling): 
	  added RunningCoupling(...) interface as an alternative to the
	  Value(...) function, whose name was rather meaningless when
	  using the globally initialised coupling.

2012-02-14  Gavin Salam  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* src/convolution.f90: 
	  added a function PartonLuminosity(grid, gq1, gq2) to efficiently
	  evaluate the partonic luminosity that comes from the "collision"
	  of two grid quantities. Its accuracy currently relies on PDFs
	  vanishing smoothly near y=0. While this routine functions
	  adequately, the exact interface and internal implementation
	  could change in the future.

	* src/welcome_message.f90: 
	  updated copyright date


2012-01-20  Gavin Salam  <gsalam@macth69.cern.ch>

	* scripts/makef95makefile:
	  arranged for gfortran to be the default compiler for all
	  architectures (previously was only for linux)

	* scripts/check:
	  fixed bug related to make check on mac (in if condition),
	  following bug report by Aneesh Manohar and Juan Rojo.

2011-11-23  Gavin SALAM  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* src/welcome_message.f90 (HoppetWelcomeMessage): 
	  updated version number to 1.1.4

	* src/new_as.f90: 
	* src/qcd_coupling.f90: 
	  fixed a couple of issues with double-declared return-value
	  variables. (Pointed out by Alberto Guffanti)

2011-03-09  Gavin Salam  <gsalam@macth69.cern.ch>

	* example_f77/variants/tabulation_example_exact_nnlo.f: ***ADDED***
          variant that illustrates how to set the exact nnlo splitting
	  functions rather than parametrised ones.

2011-03-09  Gavin SALAM  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* example_f77/tabulation_example.f:
	  corrected wrong initial PDF function in the cached part of the
	  tabulation example.

2011-02-22  Gavin Salam  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* doc/HOPPET-v1-doc.tex: 
	  documented streamlined interface to Pole v. MSbar mass choice.

	* src/streamlined_interface.f90: 
	* src/hoppet_v1.h: 
	  added support for Pole v. MSbar masses in the streamlined
	  interface, via the calls hoppetSetPoleMassVFN and
	  hoppetSetMSbarMassVFN.

	* src/welcome_message.f90: 
	  updated version number to 1.1.4-devel

	* src/evolution.f90: 
	* src/dglap_holders.f90: 
	  added support for PDF thresholds that take places at MSbar
	  masses in the evolution. The type of masses present in the
	  couplings determines what action occurs also in the PDF
	  evolution. This also involved some extra "communication"
	  functions (a little dirty?)

	* src/dglap_objects.f90: 
	  extended mass_threshold_mat so that it has all the info needed
	  for PDF mass thresholds not just for pole-quark masses but also
	  MSbar masses.

	* src/qcd_coupling.f90: 
	* src/new_as.f90: 
	  added enquiry function about quark-mass scheme, 
	  QuarkMassesAreMSbar	

	* tests/msbar_tests.f90: *** ADDED ***
	  used for checking that differences between different pole and
	  MSbar choices are genuinely of the order they should be.

2011-02-21  Gavin Salam  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* src/qcd_coupling.f90: 
	* src/new_as.f90: 
	  added support for MSbar masses to be used for crossing flavour
	  thresholds, with the new masses_are_MSbar argument.
	
	* doc/HOPPET-v1-doc.tex: 
	  added mention of MSbar masses in sections 2 and 6.1.
	
	* src/qcd.f90: 
	  minor reformatting

2010-11-07  Gavin Salam  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* scripts/makef95makefile: 

	  added default -fPIC option to default ifort and gfortran options

2010-06-17  Gavin SALAM  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* src/welcome_message.f90: 
	  upped version number to 1.1.3.1 (for new config file)

	* tarit.sh: 
	  fixed missing hoppet-config.in file.

2010-05-31  Gavin Salam  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* INSTALL: 
	* README: 
	* Makefile: 
	* scripts/makef95makefile: 
	  added an install-mod target to install f90 module files and
	  documented it.

	* example_f77/Makefile: 
	  modified things so that everything works out of the box if
	  you're using gfortran/gcc.

	* example_f77/cpp_tabulation_example.cc: 
	  fixed missing include (cstdio)

2010-05-30  Gavin Salam  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* src/dglap_objects.f90: 
	  made cobj_InitSplitLinks public to allow a user to code other
	  splitting matrices.

2009-10-09  Gavin Salam  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* src/welcome_message.f90 (HoppetWelcomeMessage): 
	  updated version to 1.1.3-devel

	* hoppet-config.in:  *** ADDED ***
	  template script which is processed to become hoppet-config
	  which gives indications of library names, etc.
	
	* scripts/makef95makefile: 
	  now outputs a .makef95.prefix file indicating what the prefix was

	* Makefile (install): 
	* configure: 
	  adapted them so that hoppet-config is properly dealt with
	
2009-09-09  Gavin SALAM  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* scripts/makef95makefile:
	  fixed typo to do with LDFLAGS.

2009-09-05  Gavin Salam  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* INSTALL:
	  moved build / installation instructions into here.

	* README:
	  updated this for new build procedure

	* configure:     *** ADDED ***
	  script to allow for new configure/make procedure (autotools
	  lookalike, at least in some simple respects). Is now the default.

	* Makefile:      *** ADDED ***
	  top-level Makefile added to go with the configure structure.

	* scripts/makef95makefile: 
	  added make install functionality, specification of compiler and
	  its options via FC and FFLAGS.

        * scripts/check   *** ADDED ***
	  for running a check on the output.

	* test.sh: 
	  switched this over to the new build and test procedure

	* scripts/install-sh:      *** ADDED ***
	  to help with installation

	* src/f77_pdftab.h: *** removed ***
	  this was obsolete, so it has been removed

2009-07-27  Gavin Salam  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* src/qcd.f90 (qcd): 
	  corrected comment in 3-loop beta fn

2008-11-22  Gavin Salam  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* src/dglap_choices.f90 (dglap_choices): 
	* src/dglap_holders.f90 (InitDglapHolder): 

    	  Following discussions with Wei-Tian Deng, introduced
	  factscheme_FragMSbar, and added support for it at 1-loop; tested
	  the momentum sum-rule and it is consistent.

	  Note that for flavour thresholds to be dealt with correctly, in
	  the initial condition one must set e.g. D_b(x,Q0^2) =
	  D_b(x,mb^2) for Q0 < mb.

2008-09-10  Gavin SALAM  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* benchmarking/prec_and_timing.f90: 
	  updated comments and fixed small warning that appears with gfortran.

	* test.sh: 
	  replaced make clean with realclean in some places (safer)

	* src/convolution.f90: 
	  small mod to out-of-range error message

2008-08-04  Gavin Salam  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* example_f90/sumrules.f90 (truncated_sum_rules): 
	  removed extraneous writes

	* tarit.sh: 
	  eliminated problem with multiple versions of .tex file ending up
	  in tarball

	* src/welcome_message.f90: 
	  updated the version number to 1.1.1

2008-08-01  Gavin Salam  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* example_f90/sumrules.f90 (truncated_sum_rules): 
	  corrected buggy array bounds

	  is a more elementary shell

	* README: 
	* example_f90/tabulation_example_2.f90: 
	  added this alternative example which does the same as
	  tabulation_example.f90, but with the information accessed across

2007-04-21  Gavin Salam  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* example_f90/benchmark.f90: *** ADDED ***
	  added this for getting the HeraLHC benchmarks 

	* example_f77/tabulation_example.f: 
	  modified it so that it uses the new routines in the
	  vanilla_interface.

	* src/f77_pdftab.f90 -> src/vanilla_interface.f90 [later]: 
          major extension of facilities offered, some renaming and chances
	  of interface
	
	* src/pdf_tabulate.f90: 
	  Long-overdue renaming of routines for pdf tables.
	  Added Q_vals(:) to the tabulation.
	  Reduced default dlnlnQ to 0.07.
	
	* src/f77_pdftab.f90 (dglapStart): 
	  fixed missing initialization of order
	  

2007-03-06  Gavin SALAM  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* src/f77_pdftab.f90: 
	  added dglapStartExtended(...) to give user more control over how
	  things are initialised

	  added dglapEvolve(...) to allow a user to take an initial
	  condition at some fixed scale and create a tabulation out of it

          changed default value for dlnlnQ to be 0.5 in in the plain dglapStart.
	

	* example_f90/tabulation_example.f90:  *** ADDED ***
          a simple example program using the f90 interface for

2006-09-07  Gavin Salam  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

        * Added the f77_pdftab.h file (may change name at some point) to
          provide an f77 interface to pdfs and their convolutions with
          splitting functions.
	
2006-05-17  Gavin Salam  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* Added du option to the various routines in evolution.f90
		
	* Added test/split_mat_ops.f90 for testing operations with
	  between splitting matrices

	* fixed deallocation bug on coefficient functions in
	  src/dglap_holder.f90 
	
2006-05-12  Gavin Salam  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* Added the RelaseNotes file
	
	* Ensured that makefiles can be generated entirely locally
	  (including addition of a copy of makePNEW.perl as
	  scripts/makef95makefile)
	* Updated README to reflect current installation procedure

2006-05-11  Gavin Salam  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* fixed another bug in sort routine (didn't seem to affect
	results, but was dodgy anyway).

2006-05-10  Gavin SALAM  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* fixed bug in sort routine; more to come...
	* added various facilities to tests/determine_accuracies.f90 
	  (but probably needs more work) (still need to add dy_min?)
	
	* Changed some more names (ev_Setdu -> SetDefaultEvolutionDu)
	* Allowed eps to be made an argument of a grid initialisation
	* Introduced query functions for eps and du
	  (DefaultConvolutionEps, DefaultEvolutionDu)
	* Introduced GetGridInfoString(grid,string) to get a 
	  description string for one's run...

	* Changed default global access to be via hoppet_v1 module
	* Changed default Qmax in f77_pdftab to 28TeV (2*LHC rts)
	* Added: src/welcome_message.f90 + introduced "HOPPET" name
	* Added: corresponding mods in convolution.

2006-05-09  Gavin Salam  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* Added tests/determine_accuracies.f90 
	* swtiched some errors in convolution.f90 (and elsewhere) over to
	the "official" warnings_and_errors handling.

2006-05-07  Gavin Salam  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

  	* Implemented deletion of grid_def's + some more name changes
	(notably, pdfset -> pdf in evolution.f90
	
        * implemented direction=-1 for mass thresholds and tested that it
	works properly, using the tests/birectional_mass_thresholds
	program (and running it with various alphas values).

	* more name changes (extra "Delete") + introduced InitEvlnOperator(...)
	
	* switched warnings_and_errors over to a new version.
	
	* changed interfaces in evolution.f90 and pdf_tabulate.f90 so as
	to make nloop an optional argument, with the default number of
	loops being deduced from the running_coupling object; also
	introduced NumberOfLoops(coupling) function for the
	running_coupling, allowing other routines to find out what is
	going on.

  	* changed directory structure (for now), with a new directory
	tests/, while the old testing directory has become testing-other
	(devoted to testing things that are not directly related the
	program development).
	
	* some name changes in evolution.f90 designed to make things more
	uniform wrt rest of program.

2006-05-05  Gavin Salam  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* moved some arguments around for the running_coupling type, and
	introduced an optional quark_masses(4:6) argument for setting the
	charm, bottom and top (pole) masses.

	* major name changes related to running coupling handling --
	hopefully it should all become somwhat more logical...

	
2006-05-04  Gavin Salam  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* moved holders.f90 -> dglap_holders.f90 (so its name now
	coincides with module name).

	* various name changes in holders.f90 (and global name changes,
	such that gd -> grid and sh -> dh).

2006-05-02  Gavin SALAM  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

   	* some more name changes in dglap_objects; removed limitation in
	MTM convolution on absence of heavy flavour (necessary to allow
	crossing of threshold when evolving downwards, where there is
	almost bound to be some residual heavy-quark piece).

	* one internal name change in convolution.f90 to avoid subsequent
	problems with SetToCommutator.
	
	* merged dglap_objects and dglap_objects hidden (which were
	separated only for support of legacy f90 compilers, hopefully no
	longer in existence). Added SetToZero, SetToConvolution,
	SetToCommutator. 
	
	* removed number of loops from the split_mat type (it wasn't being
	used).

2006-05-01  Gavin Salam  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

        * started work on giving consistent names to routines for
	working with splitting functions in dglap_objects.f90
	
        * Moved conv_objects.f90 to dglap_objects.f90, changed 
	  PMat -> split_mat
	  CMat -> coeff_mat
	  MassThresholdMat -> mass_threshold_mat
	  
	* Put some case-insensitivity into the convert.pl script.
	
        * Added version of CopyHumanPdfToEvln etc. where first argument
	is nf (integer) rather than a pdf_rep -- that should makes its use
	a bit more transparent to people. Also switched the rest of the
	code to make use of the new call and removed all prep information
	from sigma_holder. [Tested that answers are unchanged!]
	
	* further name changes throughout

	* added Delete function for sigma_holder
	
        * convolution.f90: fixed various potential memory leaks automatic
	detection of need to allocate grid_conv objects.
	
	* pdf_representation.f90: representation changes now leave decoupled
	heavy flavours unchanged, rather than setting them to zero.

2006-04-30  Gavin Salam  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* various name changes to simplify life for the user (mainly
	removal of prefixes which add little information and just make for
	more things to remember)

	* added scripts/convert.pl which carries out most of the name
	changes automatically (sometimes one or two resulting name clashes
	then had to be fixed by hand). Hopefully this script can also be
	used for conversion of existing example programs
	
	* documentation moving forwards. Section 3 on one-flavour problems
	is now at the first draft stage. Should probably next move on to
	section 4 for dealing with flavour problems.

2006-04-28  Gavin Salam  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* switched sort.f90 to be my own version.
  	* removed unused interpolation routines from interpolation.f90
	
2006-04-07  Gavin Salam  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* Added the example_f90/small_fast_tab.f90 program to examine
	timings and accuracies for a (by default) small tabulation.

	Default parameters give 10^{-4} accuracy at 3 ms/evolution over
	the small region (Rojo's request: 9-e3<x<0.75, Q<50). Timings
	increase to about 8.5ms/evolution for a larger range (1e-6<x,
	Q<14000) and I haven't checked accuracies (NB 6ms with better
	ifort optimization). Note also that eps dependence in integrations
	still needs to be checked.

        Timings below are for small table, with default parameters (see
	svn of this date!), on tycho and gaia (3.4GHz P4).
	
	                          init (s)   evln (ms)     x,Q point (mu s)
	ifort -O                     2.2       3.0               2.8
	ifort -O3 -axP               2.1       2.1               2.6
        lf95 -O                      2.7       2.2               2.2 
        gfortran -O3 -march=i686     5.9     130               180  
	g95 -O3 -march=i686          7.8      21                22            
	
	* increased default interpolation order in the pdf_tabulation to 3
	(2 was definitely too low and 4 might be better). Found that a
	slightly small spacing than used in the f77 routine could be
	beneficial (e.g. 0.07). NB: haven't checked correctness of results
	with -axP on intel (there are reports [banfi] of sporadic
	non-understood problems).
	

2006-04-06  Gavin Salam  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	Version 1.0
	
	* imported sources from the PDFevln package, with the addition of
	some f77 hooks and the removal of all the main programs; also a
	directory structure has been introduced so that the library source
	in is src/ while the example and testing programs are in separate
	directories.
