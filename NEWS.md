# NEWS for HOPPET

# Release 2.0.0, XX October 2025

## Major new features:

* inclusion of approximate N3LO splitting functions, including code from 
  FHMPRUVV group (arXiv:2410.08089 and refs therein)

* inclusion of mass threshold matrices for VFNS N3LO evolution, including
  code from ABBFMSS group (DESY 24-037 and refs therein)

* inclusion of structure function calculations, including code from (D)MVV
  group, (arXiv:1606.08907 and refs therein)

* QED evolution

* CMake build system (thanks to Andrii Verbitskyi for contributing the
  initial version). The v1 build system will be kept for the 2.0.x
  series but will not support all features.

* a Python interface (similar to the streamlined interface). The
  interface is built with SWIG (https://github.com/swig) and can be
  enabled with `-DHOPPET_BUILD_PYINTERFACE=ON`. Alternatively just `pip
  install hoppet`.
  
We are grateful to the authors of the N3LO coefficient functions,
splitting functions and mass threshold terms for providing their code. 

The updates are documented in https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.xxxxx.

## Backwards incompatible changes

* hoppet_v1 now renamed hoppet (in library name, module name, C++
  include name, etc.)

## Authorship update: 

* Frederic Dreyer, Alexander Karlberg, Paolo Nason and Giulia Zanderighi
  are now authors

## Other changes:

* access to a single flavour x,Q point of a pdf_table, with
  `EvalPdfTable_yQf` (and `_xQf` variant) and speed-up of
  `EvalPdfTable_yQ` by about a factor of three (300ns to 100 ns on an
  M2Pro). Also addition of a variant of `EvalPdfTable_yQ` that can take
  an array of tables, e.g. for speed in evaluating the same x,Q point
  for error sets.

* Interpolation order for evaluation of PDF tables can now be overridden
  with the `PdfTableOverrideInterpOrders(...)` (F90 interface) and
  `hoppetSetYLnlnQInterpOrders(...)` calls (streamlined interface).
  Setting quadratic interpolation in y and Q, this reduces PDF
  evaluation time to about 60ns, and accuracy remains good with suitably
  fine grids (`dy=0.05`).

* functionality to print a PDF from a HOPPET table in LHAPDF6 format
  (`WriteLHAPDFFromPdfTable` and `hoppetWriteLHAPDFGrid`)

* ability to declare points where the integration of convolution
  functions should be split up (split optional arg to `InitGridConv`, etc.)

* the streamlined interface now has `hoppetDeleteAll()` function for cleaning up
  all memory it allocated.

* A compiler with support for Fortran 2008 is now required, and HOPPET relies
  on extensions for long-lines (part of the Fortran 2023 standard). Compilers
  also need to be able to run the preprocessor. All features are widely supported.

* Implementation of continuous integration and a wider range of checks, including 
  a new `unit-tests/` directory

* reorganisation of the examples into `example_f90/`, `example_f77/`,
  `example_cpp/` and `example_py/`  

* various other small additions and bug fixes (see ChangeLog for details)
