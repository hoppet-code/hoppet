\begin{abstract}
  We document the three main new features in the v2 release series of the
  \hoppet parton distribution function evolution code, specifically
  support for N$^3$LO QCD evolution in the variable flavour number
  scheme, for the determination of hadronic structure functions for
  massless quarks up to N$^3$LO, and for QED evolution to an accuracy
  phenomenologically equivalent to NNLO QCD.
  %
  Additionally we describe a new Python interface, CMake build option,
  functionality to save a \hoppet table as an LHAPDF grid and update
  our performance benchmarks, including optimisations in
  interpolating PDF tables.

\section{Introduction}


\hoppet~\cite{Salam:2008qg} is a parton distribution function (PDF)
evolution code written in modern Fortran,  with interfaces also for C/\CPP{} and
earlier dialects of Fortran.
%
It offers both a high-level PDF evolution interface and user-access to
lower-level functionality for operations such as convolutions of
coefficient functions and PDFs.
%
It is designed to provide flexible, fast and accurate evolution.

Since the first major release of \hoppet, the landscape of PDF
evolution codes has evolved substantially, with a range of new
open-source codes having been developed, for example the
APFEL~\cite{Bertone:2013vaa}, \APFELPP{}~\cite{Bertone:2017gds} and
EKO~\cite{Candido:2022tld} codes supplementing earlier widely-used
public codes such as QCDNUM~\cite{Botje} and
PEGASUS~\cite{Pegasus}.\footnote{Other codes such as 
  ChiliPDF~\cite{Diehl:2021gvs} appear to not yet be public.}
%
Nevertheless, \hoppet remains a powerful tool, notably for its ability
to reach high and quantifiable accuracies with competitive speed.
%
As a result it often provides a critical reference for benchmark
studies, as those presented e.g.\ in
Refs.~\cite{Dittmar:2005ed,Bertone:2024dpm}.
%
It also provides the option of fast (millisecond-scale) evolution with
accuracies $\sim 10^{-4}$, which is more than sufficient for
phenomenological applications.
%
%
Furthermore \hoppet's exposition not just of full PDF
evolution (as exploited in Refs.~\cite{Lai:2010vv,Gao:2013xoa,Butterworth:2015oua,Hou:2019efy,PDF4LHCWorkingGroup:2022cjn}),
but also of low-level functionality though a stable, public API, has
led to its use for a range of
fixed-order~\cite{Caola:2019nzf,Asteriadis:2019dte,Bargiela:2022dla},
all-order~\cite{Banfi:2010xy,Dasgupta:2014yra,Banfi:2015pju,Monni:2016ktx,Bizon:2017rah,Buonocore:2024xmy}
and Monte
Carlo~\cite{Monni:2019whf,vanBeekveld:2023ivn,Buonocore:2024pdv,vanBeekveld:2025lpz}
applications.
%
With the advent of ever more precise data from the LHC at CERN, and
future very high precision data at the forthcoming Electron-Ion
Collider~\cite{AbdulKhalek:2021gbh} at Brookhaven National Laboratory,
the continued development of tools such as \hoppet remains important
for the field.

This release note documents three major additions to \hoppet, made
available as part of release~2.0.0: 
%
(1) support for QCD evolution at N$^3$LO in the (zero mass) variable
flavour number scheme (VFNS)~\cite{Buza:1996wv} (Section~\ref{sec:n3lo-evolution});
%
(2) support for the
determination of massless hadronic structure functions, as initially developed
for calculations of vector-boson fusion, and later deep inelastic scattering, cross
sections~\cite{Cacciari:2015jma,Dreyer:2016oyx,Dreyer:2018qbw,Dreyer:2018rfu,Karlberg:2024hnl}
(Section~\ref{sec:structure-funcs});
%
(3) support for QED evolution (Section~\ref{sec:qed-evolution}),
originally developed as part of the LuxQED project for the evaluation
of the photon density inside a proton and its extension to lepton
distributions in the
proton~\cite{Manohar:2016nzj,Manohar:2017eqh,Buonocore:2020nai,Buonocore:2021bsf}.

This release also includes a range of other additions relative
to the original 1.1.0 release documented in \cite{Salam:2008qg}, in
particular a Python interface
(Section~\ref{sec:pyinterface}), a CMake-based build system
(Section~\ref{sec:cmake}), and the ability to write LHAPDF grids
(Section~\ref{sec:lhapdf}).
%
We have also updated the performance benchmarks and improved the speed
for interpolating PDF tables also when loaded from LHAPDF (Section~\ref{sec:v2-performance}).
%
\hoppet can be obtained by executing
\begin{lstlisting}
  git clone https://github.com/hoppet-code/hoppet.git
  cd hoppet
  git switch -d hoppet-2.x.y  # to switch to a specific release tag, e.g. hoppet-2.1.0
\end{lstlisting}
Unified documentation of the whole \hoppet package is part of the
distribution at \url{https://github.com/hoppet-code/hoppet} in the
\masterlink{docs/manual} directory.
%
Details of the other changes since release 1.1.0 can be found in the
\masterlink{NEWS.md} and \masterlink{ChangeLog} files from the
repository.
%
\medskip

\noindent \fbox{\parbox{\textwidth}{
\textbf{Note that as of the 2.0.0 release, \hoppet's library name has been renamed
from \texttt{hoppet\_v1} to \texttt{hoppet}, and similarly for the main
module and \CPP include file.
%
Users with an existing installation of \hoppet (v1) should make sure
that they link with the new library name.
%
Apart from this, v2 remains fully backwards compatible with code
designed for v1.

\section{Brief summary of \hoppet structure}
\label{sec:hoppet-structure}

\hoppet works in $x$-space.
%
It represents PDFs and splitting functions on grids, typically
multiple nested grids, each uniform in $y= \ln 1/x$, with the nesting
involving smaller spacings and smaller $y$ ranges so as to achieve
good accuracy not just at small $x$ but also large $x$.
%
The underlying convolutions of splitting functions with PDFs
effectively use piecewise polynomial interpolations of the PDFs.
%
The convolutions of the splitting functions with individual basis
polynomials are pre-evaluated using adaptive Gaussian integration.
%
Evolution equations are solved using Runge-Kutta methods.

\begin{table}[pt!]
  \centering
  \input{interface-tables/streamlined.tex}
  \caption{Core methods of the streamlined interface in Fortran and \CPP.
    %
    In Python, \ttt{hoppetStart(...)} is to be replaced with
    \ttt{hoppet.Start(...)}, and routines like \ttt{hoppet.Eval(...)}
    and \ttt{LHAsub(x,Q)} return
    \texttt{f} rather than taking \texttt{f} as an argument and
    filling it.
    %
    \label{tab:streamlined-interface}
  }
\end{table}


The code has two interfaces.
%
For simple usage, it provides a so-called ``streamlined''
interface, giving high-level access to the functionality that is most
widely needed.
%
It is available from Fortran, \CPP and, as of v2, Python
(cf.\ Sec.~\ref{sec:pyinterface}).
%
Its main routines are listed in Table~\ref{tab:streamlined-interface}.
%
The functionality includes evolving to fill a PDF tabulation and then
accessing that PDF tabulation at given $x,Q$ points.
%
For faster tabulation of many distinct initial conditions, one can
pre-determine (cache) the evolution operators between the different
$Q$ scales at which the PDF is tabulated, and then repeatedly apply
that cached evolution.
%
The streamlined interface also provides access to convolutions of the
various orders of splitting functions with the tabulated PDF.


\begin{table}[pt!]
  \centering
  \input{interface-tables/general-objects.tex}
  \caption{Core objects in the general interface.
    %
    \label{tab:general-interface}
  }
\end{table}


For more advanced usage there is a ``general'' interface (sometimes
called the object-oriented interface, though it is only partially so).
%
It gives access to the various low-level objects that are useful in
DGLAP evolution, such as splitting functions, splitting matrices,
tabulations of PDFs, etc.
%
The main objects are listed in Table~\ref{tab:general-interface}.
%
Up to v2.1, that interface is accessible only in modern Fortran,
though in due course we expect to extend it to other languages.
%
We refer the reader to the original manual~\cite{Salam:2008qg} for an
extended discussion of the general interface.
%
For some uses, it can be convenient to initialise \hoppet with the
streamlined interface and then access the underlying objects in
Fortran from the
\repolink{src/streamlined_interface.f90}{streamlined\_interface}
module. 

Various examples are available with the two sets of interfaces, to be
found in the \masterlink{examples/} directory of the repository.
%
This document will focus mostly on the streamlined interface, though
in a places we will also discuss key additions to the general interface.

\section{Conclusion}

Version 2 of \hoppet brings major additions to its functionality.
%
These include evolution up to N$^3$LO, massless structure function
evaluation, QED evolution, a Python interface, a modern build system,
functionality for writing LHAPDF grids and significant speed
improvements in the interpolation of its internal PDF tables.

Overall \hoppet remains highly competitive in terms of speed and
accuracy.
%
For example, repeated filling of a full PDF tabulation takes about a
millisecond per initial condition, with a relative accuracy of
$10^{-4}$ or better for $10^{-5} < x<0.9$.
%
It offers explicit handles to control the accuracy, allowing users to
verify the precision of their results and choose the optimal trade-off
between speed and precision.
%
Its modern Fortran interface also offers powerful and flexible access
to a range of common PDF manipulations such as convolutions with
arbitrary splitting and coefficient functions, features that are
useful in a variety of contexts.

We hope that this release of \hoppet can help provide solid
foundations for a range of groups to contribute to the ongoing
discussions~\cite{McGowan:2022nag,NNPDF:2024nan,Cooper-Sarkar:2024crx,Cridge:2024icl,Cooper-Sarkar:2025sqw}
in the field concerning the impact of \ntlo and QED effects in PDF
fits.
%
We also hope that the interfaces across computing languages will
facilitate the practical aspects of integration with a range of other
tools.
