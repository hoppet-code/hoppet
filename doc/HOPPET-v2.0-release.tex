\begin{abstract}
  We document the three main new features in release 2.0.0 of the
  \hoppet parton distribution function evolution code, specifically
  support for N$^3$LO QCD evolution in the variable flavour number
  scheme, for the determination of hadronic structure functions for
  massless quarks up to N$^3$LO, and for QED evolution to an accuracy
  phenomenologically equivalent to NNLO QCD.
  %
  Additionally we describe a new Python interface, CMake build option,
  functionality to save a \hoppet table as an LHAPDF grid and update
  our performance benchmarks, including optimisations in
  interpolating PDF tables.

\section{Introduction}


\hoppet~\cite{Salam:2008qg} is a parton distribution function (PDF)
evolution code written in modern Fortran,\footnote{This release of
\hoppet makes use of features introduced in Fortran~2008, for example
its \ttt{abstract interface}, and hence a Fortran~2008 compliant
compiler is now needed. The code has been tested to compile and run
with \texttt{gfortran v10.5.0} and later, and the 2025 version of the
Intel compiler \texttt{ifx}.}  with interfaces also for C/\CPP{} and
earlier dialects of Fortran.
%
It offers both a high-level PDF evolution interface and user-access to
lower-level functionality for operations such as convolutions of
coefficient functions and PDFs.
%
It is designed to provide flexible, fast and accurate evolution.

Since the first major release of \hoppet, the landscape of PDF
evolution codes has evolved substantially, with a range of new open-source
codes having been developed, for example the APFEL~\cite{Bertone:2013vaa}, \APFELPP{}~\cite{Bertone:2017gds} and EKO~\cite{Candido:2022tld}
codes (the latter including
features such as cached evolution that have long been standard in
\hoppet).\footnote{Other codes such as ChiliPDF~\cite{Diehl:2021gvs}
  appear to not yet be public.}
%
Nevertheless, \hoppet remains a powerful tool, notably for its ability
to reach high and quantifiable accuracies with competitive speed.
%
As a result it often provides a critical reference for benchmark
studies, as those presented e.g.\ in
Refs.~\cite{Dittmar:2005ed,Bertone:2024dpm}.
%
It also provides the option of fast (millisecond-scale) evolution with
accuracies $\sim 10^{-4}$, which is more than sufficient for
phenomenological applications.
%
%
Furthermore its exposition not just of full PDF
evolution~\cite{Lai:2010vv,Gao:2013xoa,Butterworth:2015oua,PDF4LHCWorkingGroup:2022cjn}
but also of low-level functionality makes it useful for a range of
fixed-order~\cite{Caola:2019nzf,Asteriadis:2019dte,Bargiela:2022dla},
all-order~\cite{Banfi:2010xy,Dasgupta:2014yra,Banfi:2015pju,Monni:2016ktx,Bizon:2017rah,Buonocore:2024xmy}
and Monte
Carlo~\cite{Monni:2019whf,vanBeekveld:2023ivn,Buonocore:2024pdv,vanBeekveld:2025lpz}
applications.
%
With the advent of ever more precise data from the LHC at CERN, and
future very high precision data at the forthcoming Electron-Ion
Collider~\cite{AbdulKhalek:2021gbh} at Brookhaven National Laboratory,
the continued development of tools such as \hoppet remains important
for the field.

This release note documents three major additions to \hoppet, made
available as part of release~2.0.0: 
%
(1) support for QCD evolution at N$^3$LO in the (zero mass) variable
flavour number scheme (VFNS)~\cite{Buza:1996wv} (Section~\ref{sec:n3lo-evolution});
%
(2) support for the
determination of massless hadronic structure functions, as initially developed
for calculations of vector-boson fusion, and later deep inelastic scattering, cross
sections~\cite{Cacciari:2015jma,Dreyer:2016oyx,Dreyer:2018qbw,Dreyer:2018rfu,Karlberg:2024hnl}
(Section~\ref{sec:structure-funcs}).
%
(3) support for QED evolution (Section~\ref{sec:qed-evolution}),
originally developed as part of the LuxQED project for the evaluation
of the photon density inside a proton and its extension to lepton
distributions in the
proton~\cite{Manohar:2016nzj,Manohar:2017eqh,Buonocore:2020nai,Buonocore:2021bsf};

This release also includes a range of other additions relative
to the original 1.1.0 release documented in \cite{Salam:2008qg}, in
particular a Python interface
(Section~\ref{sec:pyinterface}), a CMake-based build system
(Section~\ref{sec:cmake}), and the ability to write LHAPDF grids
(Section~\ref{sec:lhapdf}).
%
We have also updated the performance benchmarks and improved the speed
for interpolating PDF tables also when loaded from LHAPDF (Section~\ref{sec:v2-performance}).
%
Unified documentation of the whole \hoppet package is part of the
distribution at \url{https://github.com/hoppet-code/hoppet} in the
\masterlink{doc/} directory.
%
Details of the other changes since release 1.1.0 can be found in the
\masterlink{NEWS.md} and \masterlink{ChangeLog} files from the
repository.\medskip

\noindent \fbox{\parbox{\textwidth}{
\textbf{Note that for this 2.0.0 release, \hoppet's library name has been renamed
from \texttt{hoppet\_v1} to \texttt{hoppet}, and similarly for the main
module and \CPP include file.

Users with an existing installation of \hoppet (v1) should make sure
that they link with the new library name.}

\section{Conclusion}

Version 2 of \hoppet brings major additions to its functionality.
%
These include evolution up to N$^3$LO, massless structure function
evaluation, QED evolution, a Python interface, a modern build system,
functionality for writing LHAPDF grids and significant speed
improvements in the interpolation of its internal PDF tables.

Overall \hoppet remains highly competitive in terms of speed and
accuracy.
%
For example, repeated filling of a full PDF tabulation takes about a
millisecond per initial condition, with a relative accuracy of
$10^{-4}$ or better for $10^{-5} < x<0.9$.
%
It offers explicit handles to control the accuracy, allowing users to
verify the precision of their results and choose the optimal trade-off
between speed and precision.
%
Its modern Fortran interface also offers powerful and flexible access
to a range of common PDF manipulations such as convolutions with
arbitrary splitting and coefficient functions, features that are
useful in a variety of contexts.

We hope that this release of \hoppet can help provide solid
foundations for a range of groups to contribute to the ongoing
discussions~\cite{McGowan:2022nag,NNPDF:2024nan,Cooper-Sarkar:2024crx,Cridge:2024icl,Cooper-Sarkar:2025sqw}
in the field concerning the impact of \ntlo and QED effects in PDF
fits.
%
We also hope that the interfaces across computing languages will
facilitate the practical aspects of integration with a range of other
tools.
