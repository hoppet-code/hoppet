\begin{abstract}
  We document the three main new features in release 2.0.0 of the
  \hoppet parton distribution function evolution code, specifically
  support for QED evolution to an accuracy phenomenologically
  equivalent to NNLO QCD, for N$^3$LO QCD evolution in the variable
  flavour number scheme, and for the determination of hadronic
  structure functions for massless quarks up to N$^3$LO. Additionally
  we describe a new Python interface and CMake build option. \ak{This
    release breaks backwards compatibility insofar only that the
    suffix \texttt{\_v1} has been dropped from \texttt{hoppet\_v1} in
    all places -- most importantly from \texttt{libhoppet\_v1} which
    has now become \texttt{libhoppet}.}

\section{Introduction}

\hoppet is a parton distribution function (PDF) evolution code written
in Fortran~95\footnote{This release of \hoppet makes use of features
introduced in Fortran~2003, in particular its \ttt{abstract
  interface}, and hence a Fortran~2003 compliant compiler is now needed.},
with interfaces also for C/\CPP{} and earlier dialects of Fortran.
%
It offers both a high-level PDF evolution interface and user-access to
lower-level functionality for operations such as convolutions of
coefficient functions and PDFs, and is designed to provide flexible and
fast evolution.

This release note documents three major additions to \hoppet, made
available as part of release~2.0.0: (1) support for QED evolution,
originally developed as part of the LuxQED project for the evaluation
of the photon density inside a proton and its extension to lepton
distributions in the
proton~\cite{Manohar:2016nzj,Manohar:2017eqh,Buonocore:2020nai,Buonocore:2021bsf};
%
(2) support for QCD evolution at N$^3$LO in the (zero mass) variable
flavour number scheme (VFNS)~\cite{Buza:1996wv};
%
and (3) support for the
determination of massless hadronic structure functions, as initially developed
for calculations of vector-boson fusion cross
sections~\cite{Cacciari:2015jma,Dreyer:2016oyx,Dreyer:2018qbw,Dreyer:2018rfu}.

This release also includes a range of other smaller additions relative
to the original 1.1.0 release documented in \cite{Salam:2008qg}, in
particular the addition of a new Python interface and CMake build
option.
%
Unified documentation of the whole \hoppet package is part of the
distribution at \url{https://github.com/hoppet-code/hoppet} in the
\masterlink{doc/} directory.
%
Details of the other changes since release 1.1.0 can be found in the
\masterlink{NEWS} and \masterlink{ChangeLog} files from the
repository.

\section{Conclusion}

The \hoppet additions described here provide fast access to QED
evolution and to structure-function calculations, including evolution
in the VFNS at N$^3$LO, which we hope may be of benefit beyond the
projects where they have already been used.
