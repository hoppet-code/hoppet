HOPPET: Higher Order Perturbative Parton Evolution Toolkit
==========================================================

HOPPET is a Fortran package for carrying out DGLAP evolution and
other common manipulations of parton distribution functions (PDFs). 

Within HOPPET, PDFs are represented on a grid in x-space so as to
avoid limitations on the functional form of input
distributions. Decent speed and accuracy are obtained through the
representation of splitting functions in terms of their convolution
with a set of piecewise polynomial basis functions, and Runge-Kutta
techniques are used for the evolution in Q.

Unpolarised evolution is provided in the MSbar scheme to N3LO in the
coupling, including heavy-quark thresholds, and polarised evolution to
NLO. The code is structured so as to provide simple access to the
objects representing splitting function and PDFs, making it possible
for a user to extend the facilities already provided.

The latest version can always be obtained from

    git clone https://github.com/hoppet-code/hoppet

Details of changes are to be found in the file ChangeLog, while
summaries of changes between releases are in ReleaseNotes.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
Note on changes since v2.0.0
-------------

Starting from v2.0.0 backwards compatibility with the v1 series of
hoppet has been broken in one significant way, namely that `hoppet_v1`
has become `hoppet` in all places in the code. This in particular
applies to `libhoppet_v1` which is now `libhoppet`, `module hoppet_v1`
which is now `module hoppet` and the C++ namespace `hoppet_v1` which
is now `hoppet`.

Besides this change most users should be able to start using the v2
series without any difficulties.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Note on Fortran compilers
-------------

Hoppet is developed and tested with recent versions of the gfortran
compiler. It should also work with the Intel (ifx) and IBM (xlf)
compilers. 

Build with `configure` script
-----------------------------
For details see the INSTALL file. To get moving quickly, just specify
an installation prefix and a fortran compiler (FC), and then do

    ./configure --prefix="..."  FC="..."
    make 
    make check
    make install      [if you're interested]
    make install-mod  [if you want the f90 module files installed too]

This is not autotools based: if you're used to more advanced usage of
autotools scripts, you'll be disappointed here...

Build with `CMake`
------------------

```bash
mkdir build
cmake -S . -B build <extra flags>
cmake --build  build -j 
cmake --install build
ctest --test-dir build
```

The extra flags might be:
- generic `CMake` flags, e.g. `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/my/home/dir`, `-DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=ifort`, `-DCMAKE_Fortran_FLAGS="-O2 -g"`, etc.
- flags pointing to the dependencies, `-DLHAPDF_DIR=/where/the/LHAPDF/is`,
- `HOPPET_USE_EXACT_COEF`    Use exact coefficient functions.
- `HOPPET_BUILD_EXAMPLES`    Build examples.
- `HOPPET_ENABLE_TESTING`    Enable testing. Requires building the examples.
- `HOPPET_BUILD_BENCHMARK`   Build benchmark.
- `HOPPET_ENABLE_FPES`       Enable trapping of the floating point exceptions. Recommended for usage with debug builds, 
   i.e. `-DCMAKE_BUILDTYPE=DEBUG`

Usage in `CMake`-based projects
-------------------------------
If hoppet is build with `CMake` it is possible to import its targets into other projects.
Namely, a minimal working project 

    cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.12)
    project(mytest LANGUAGES Fortran)
    find_package(hoppet)
    add_executable(tabulation_example tabulation_example.f90)
    target_link_libraries(tabulation_example PUBLIC hoppet::hoppet_static)

could be configured with 


    cmake -S . -B BUILD -Dhoppet_DIR=hoppet/installation/share/hoppet/cmake


Example programs
----------------

### Streamlined interface

The simplest way to use HOPPET is through its streamlined interface.
There are examples for basic QCD evolution in 
- modern Fortran:
[example_f90/tabulation_example_streamlined.f90](example_f90/tabulation_example_streamlined.f90)
- Fortran 77: [example_f77/tabulation_example.f](example_f77/tabulation_example.f) 
- C++: [example_f77/cpp_tabulation_example.cc](example_f77/cpp_tabulation_example.cc)

Other features illustrated in the examples include

- accessing convolutions with splitting functions ([Fortran](example_f77/convolution_example.f9))
- QCD+QED evolution ([Fortran](example_f90/tabulation_example_qed_streamlined.f90), [C++](example_f77/cpp_tabulation_example_qed.cc))
- massless structure functions ([Fortran](example_f90/structure_functions_example.f90), [C++](example_f77/cpp_structure_functions_example.cc))
- comparisons with LHAPDF ([Fortran](example_f77/compare_lhapdf_hoppet.f))


### Full interface  
The Fortran examples also illustrate usage of the full lower-level interface,
allowing fine-grained access to the underlying objects, which provide a
powerful and flexible framework for convolution and evolution.
See for example
[example_f90/tabulation_example.f90](example_f90/tabulation_example.f90).
An equivalent program with the startup, pdf initialisation and
evolution spread across different subroutines is given as
[example_f90/tabulation_example_2.f90](example_f90/tabulation_example_2.f90).

### Building the examples

For the `CMake` based build the examples are compiled  if 
`-DHOPPET_BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON` flag is set. To build the examples with 
`configure` look inside the suppplied Makefile and if need be edit it manually.

```bash
cd ../example_f77
# <edit the Makefile directly>
# compile
make tabulation_example
# run the program. Should give output identical to that from
# example_f90/tabulation_example
./tabulation_example
```

In the same directory there is a C++ [example](example_f77/cpp_tabulation_example.cc)

     make cpp_tabulation_example
     ./cpp_tabulation_example

which again does the same things (though in this case it uses the
simpler of the two streamlined initialization calls).

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Documentation
-------------

Detailed documentation is available as
[doc/HOPPET-v1-doc.tex](doc/HOPPET-v1-doc.tex). If you use HOPPET in a
scientific publication, please refer to
http://arxiv.org/abs/0804.3755. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------
Benchmarking
------------

The benchmarking/ directory contains the programs used for the full
benchmarking, accuracy and precision testing. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------
Compiler warnings
-----------------

When the hoppet library is being built, on some systems the following
warnings may be reported 

    /usr/bin/ranlib: file: libhoppet_v1.a(hoppet_v1.o) has no symbols
    /usr/bin/ranlib: file: libhoppet_v1.a(types.o) has no symbols
    
    ranlib: file: libhoppet_v1.a(hoppet_v1.o) has no symbols
    ranlib: file: libhoppet_v1.a(types.o) has no symbols

These warnings do not indicate an actual problem. They are simply a
consequence of the fact that some of the source (.f90) files contain
only information about interfaces and constants, so that the resulting
object (.o) files are essentially empty.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Branches
--------

The [master](https://github.com/hoppet-code/hoppet/tree/master) branch
provides the official HOPPET release. There are currently no other
branches under active development.
