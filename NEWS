NEWS for HOPPET

======================================================================
Release 2.0.0, XX June 2025
======================================================================

Major new features:
* inclusion of QED evolution
* inclusion of structure function calculations, including code from (D)MVV group, 
  (arXiv:1606.08907 and refs therein)
* inclusion of approximate N3LO splitting functions, including code from 
  FHMPRUVV group (arXiv:2410.08089 and refs therein)
* inclusion of mass threshold matrices for VFNS N3LO evolution, including
  code from ABBFMSS group (DESY 24-037 and refs therein)
* inclusion of a python interface (similar to the streamlined interface)

We are grateful to the authors of the N3LO coefficient functions,
splitting functions and mass threshold terms for providing their code. 

Authorship update: 
* Frederic Dreyer, Alexander Karlberg, Paolo Nason and Giulia Zanderighi
  are now authors

Other changes:
* A compiler with support for Fortran 2008 is now required
* various small bug fixes (see ChangeLog for details)
* ability to declare points where the integration of convolution
  functions should be split up (split optional arg to InitGridConv, etc.)
* access to a single flavour x,Q point of a pdf_table, with EvalPdfTable_yQf
  (and _xQf variant) and speed-up of EvalPdfTable_yQ by about 20% for order=-6.
* streamlined interface now has hoppetDeleteAll() function for cleaning up
  all memory it allocated.
* Users have a choice between traditional makefiles and the CMake build
  system. CMake is now the preferred option. The two should not be
  used concurrently in the same directory.

======================================================================
Release 1.2.0, 30 October 2020
======================================================================
* hoppetEvalSplit now supports composite iloop value, e.g. iloop=12
  to get PLO*PNLO*pdf
* 4-loop running coupling is now available
* Frederic Dreyer and Alexander Karlberg joined as contributors
* small fixes to build system and examples, memory management


======================================================================
Release 1.1.5  August 2012
======================================================================
* a PartonLuminosity(...) function has been added (see manual)
* modules are now installed by default with make install
* default module installation location is now PREFIX/include/hoppet/
* hoppet-config now accepts an --fflags option
* fixed NaN problems in tabulation at Q values below lower edge of table
* small fixes to build and check system, error messages

======================================================================
Release 1.1.4  November 2011
======================================================================
* mass thresholds now available at MSbar masses as well as pole masses
* fixes for compatibility with gfortran 4.5 upwards

======================================================================
Release 1.1.3  May 2010
======================================================================
* small bug fixes to build system
* addition of hoppet-config script

======================================================================
Release 1.1.2  September 2009
======================================================================

* new build system (configure lookalike).

* added 1-loop time-like (fragmentation function) evolution following
  discussions with Wei-Tian Deng. Only partially tested.

======================================================================
Release 1.1.1  August 2008
======================================================================

* added TruncatedMoment routine (e.g. for verifying sum-rules)

* added ability to extract a whole pdf(x,flav) at a given Q from a
  tabulation, with the EvalPdfTable_Q routine

* clarifications and other small changes in the documentation

======================================================================
Release 1.1.0  April 2008
======================================================================

* Name changed to hoppet
* Many internal name changes to provide more consistent user-interface
* Some changes in setting of default grid and evolution parameters
* Documentation written
